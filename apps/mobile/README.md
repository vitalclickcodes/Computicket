# Computicket Nigeria — Mobile

Flutter app for buyers: browse events, sign in (with 2FA), buy tickets through
Paystack's hosted checkout, and display tickets as QR codes.

## Scope

Buyer flows
- Sign up / sign in (email + password, with TOTP 2FA challenge)
- Browse + search published events
- Event detail with multi-tier ticket selection; reserved-seating events
  surface a tap-to-select seat grid driven by `/v1/ticket-types/:id/seats`
- "Buy" opens Paystack hosted checkout
- "My tickets" → QR display
- Wallet: balance + transaction history + Paystack-funded top-up

Organizer member flows
- Dashboard listing every organizer the user is a member of, plus a
  per-org overview (total sold + revenue, event status + sell-through
  bar per event)
- Scanner: camera QR → `POST /v1/tickets/scan`, with green/orange/red
  banners for valid / already-scanned / refused

Out of scope (still): add-ons, white-label theming, organizer
event-edit / publish, KYC submission, refunds. The web app covers
those today.

## First-time setup

This repo deliberately does **not** check in the auto-generated platform
shells (`ios/`, `android/`, `web/`, `linux/`, `macos/`, `windows/`).
They're regenerated on demand so the upstream Flutter SDK can evolve
without polluting the diff. Before your first run:

```sh
cd apps/mobile
flutter create --no-overwrite --org ng.computicket --project-name computicket_mobile .
flutter pub get
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

The third command reads the `flutter_launcher_icons:` block in
`pubspec.yaml` and rasters `assets/icon.png` into every Android density
bucket, the iOS asset catalogue, and the web `favicon.png`. Re-run it
whenever `assets/icon.png` changes. The CI workflow at
`.github/workflows/mobile.yml` does both steps automatically.

### Platform manifests we track by hand

Two files inside the otherwise-ignored platform shells are checked
in because they carry runtime permissions we don't want re-deriving
each time someone runs `flutter create .`:

| File | What it carries |
|---|---|
| `ios/Runner/Info.plist` | `NSCameraUsageDescription` (scanner camera prompt) plus the standard Flutter bundle keys |
| `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` | `CAMERA` + `INTERNET` permissions, optional camera hardware features, and the `<queries>` clause `url_launcher` needs on Android 11+ to open the Paystack hosted checkout in an external browser |

`flutter create --no-overwrite` leaves both files alone since they
already exist. If you ever need to reset them to the upstream Flutter
template, delete them and re-run `flutter create .` — but you'll
have to re-add the permission strings before scanning works again.

The scanner screen surfaces the OS-level camera prompt the first
time, and the API enforces the `OrganizerMember(SCANNER+)` role on
`/v1/tickets/scan` so an unauthorised scan attempt still fails
cleanly with a 403.

## Pointing at the API

The base URL is a compile-time constant resolved from the `API_URL`
dart-define, defaulting to `http://10.0.2.2:4000/v1` (the Android
emulator's host loopback). Override per build:

```sh
# Local API on a physical device
flutter run --dart-define=API_URL=http://192.168.1.10:4000/v1

# Staging
flutter run --dart-define=API_URL=https://staging.computicket.ng/v1
```

iOS Simulator hits `http://localhost:4000/v1` directly — pass that via
`--dart-define`.

## Development

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run            # device/emulator
```

## What's stored where

- JWT + email + display name → `shared_preferences`. For a production
  release move the JWT into `flutter_secure_storage` so it's
  keychain/keystore-backed; the AuthStore interface won't change.
- No other client-side persistence. Orders, tickets, and event data are
  fetched on demand.

## Architecture notes

- `lib/api/` — HTTP client and JSON models. Stateless; constructed once
  in `main.dart` and injected via `provider`.
- `lib/state/auth_store.dart` — `ChangeNotifier` that owns auth state;
  the `GoRouter` listens to it so login/logout redirects are reactive.
- `lib/screens/` — one file per route. `shell.dart` is the bottom-nav
  scaffold for the three tabs (Events, Tickets, Profile).
- `lib/router.dart` — `go_router` config with auth-aware redirect.

## Known follow-ups

- Move JWT to `flutter_secure_storage`
- In-app web view for Paystack instead of the external browser, so the
  return URL can be intercepted and the Tickets tab refreshed
  automatically
- Push notifications when an order completes
- Localisation (i18n) beyond `en_NG`
- App icon + splash screen artwork (the `flutter create` defaults ship
  the Flutter dash; the `docs/Computicket-icon.png` checked into the
  repo can be wired in via `flutter_launcher_icons`)
